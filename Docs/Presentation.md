# Presentation Invariants

## Piece renderer ownership

`PuzzlePiece` keeps authored presentation renderers in `Ice Presentation Slots` on the pooled `BlockPiece` prefab.

The first renderer in this collection is reserved for the intact whole-piece silhouette (`wholePieceRenderer`). It must not be borrowed by bomb, ice, frost, release, or other overlay effects.

Overlay allocation must use the existing available-slot selection path so it excludes:

* `wholePieceRenderer`;
* renderers already owned by an active overlay;
* and renderers currently composing a joined piece presentation.

Bomb overlays and ice layers both use `TryGetAvailableIceSlot`. Do not restore
direct collection indexing: slot zero may be the whole-piece renderer even when
the active overlay list is empty.

Presentation slots are pooled state. Every renter must receive reset sprite, material, colour, transform, sorting, mask, enabled state, and property-block state.

## Whole-piece and modular fallback selection

Gameplay colliders and board cells remain unchanged when presentation switches between these paths:

1. Use an exact artist-authored atlas silhouette when the normalized module shape has a configured match.
2. Otherwise compose contiguous horizontal and vertical runs from joined fallback sprites.
3. Use individual 1x1 modules only for cells not covered by an exact or joined presentation.

Hammer fragments must rebuild presentation from their retained authoritative cells. A two-cell horizontal or vertical fragment must use the exact `2x1` or `1x2` atlas sprite when available; it must not resize a `3x1` or `1x3` texture into two cells because that compresses the stud count and lighting.

## Obstacles

Obstacle gameplay collision and obstacle visuals have separate ownership:

* `Obstacle N Collision` objects provide static collision.
* A matching atlas silhouette is rendered as `Merged Obstacle Visual`.
* Shapes without a matching silhouette are decomposed into `Sliced Obstacle Visual` rectangles and join visuals.

Visual merging must never change authored obstacle cells, collider dimensions, or board occupancy.

## Presentation refreshes

A presentation refresh may rewrite sprites, materials, visibility, sorting, and overlay state. It must not repair gameplay state as a side effect. If a visual appears only after another piece is destroyed or shredded, treat that as evidence of stale or conflicting presentation ownership rather than relying on the later refresh.
